# Detectinator
A project which can be used by people to quickly check their respiratory health.

The current covid testing method of RTPCR is slow, painful and very cumbersome. Moreover, in places where there are extreme conditions and lack of proper infrastructure, a lot of precious time is wasted in the transport, storage and maintenance of the testing kits, tools and samples.
This is where our technology comes in. We have created a smart platform using AI which effectively detects and provides accurate results in respiratory diseases like the ongoing Covid-19, pneumonia and asthma. 
People will be able to easily access the platform and check for any such respiratory issues instantly.

Technologies Used-
*Model training of CNNs,ANNs in DL* 
*Back-end integration using Django-Flask*
*Front-end integration of model using REACT* 
*Pre-processing of raw data for datasets using Python Libraries*
*Audacity*
