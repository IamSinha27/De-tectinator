A project which can be used by people to quickly check their respiratory health.

The current covid testing method of RTPCR is slow, painful and very cumbersome. Moreover, in places where there are extreme conditions and lack of proper infrastructure, a lot of precious time is wasted in the transport, storage and maintenance of the testing kits, tools and samples.
This is where our technology comes in. We have created a smart platform using AI which effectively detects and provides accurate results in respiratory diseases like the ongoing Covid-19, pneumonia and asthma. 
People will be able to easily access the platform and check for any such respiratory issues instantly.

#About us:


Deep learning can be used to Detect COVID-19 ( classify whether a person is covid positive or negative) using the acoustic signals present in the foced-cough audio.

The acoustic signals are extrapolated and displayed on Mel Spectrograms (as shown below).

We trained a Convolutional neural network to classify the images with a validation accuracy of about 93%( graph shown below).

CNN model finally predicts the outcome , which is displayed on your screen.
